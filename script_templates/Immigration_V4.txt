   Opponents of illegal immigration are fond of telling foreigners to “get in line” before coming to work in America. But what does that line actually look like, and how many years (or decades) does it take to get through? Try it yourself!

===FamilyIsCitizen.EasyPath
   Congratulations! You’ve found one of the easiest ways to become an American. There is no annual cap on the number of spouses, minor children, or parents of U.S. citizens who can enter, and they generally can receive green cards.
   After five years (three if you’re a spouse), a green card holder is eligible to become a citizen.
   After you file your naturalization papers and endure six to 12 months of processing delays, you can take a language and civics test. Pass it, and you’re a citizen. 
   Total time to immigrate and become a citizen: BEST CASE: SIX TO SEVEN YEARS

   Adult children and siblings of U.S. citizens can apply for a green card.

   Married adult children: seven- to-15-year wait.
   Siblings of US. citizens: 11-to-22-year wait.

If an employer can’t wait six to 10 years for you to start work... is he willing to apply for your temporary work visa (H-1B)?
+ Yes -> H1BVisa
+ No -> OutOfLuck

===H1BVisa
   Then you have a 50/50 chance of getting your H-1B, because these visas are capped at 85,000 per year, well below the total demand. They run out on the first day they become available. If you are lucky enough to get one, you can start working in fl the country and your employer can apply for your labor certification and green card. 
+ Summary -> END

===NoFamily.NoSkills
   Sorry! There is virtually no process for unskilled immigrants without relations in the U.S. to apply for permanent legal residence. Only 10,000 green cards are allotted every year, and the wait time approaches infinity. (Those who receive H-2A or H-2B temporary visas for seasonal work cannot transition to a green card.)

===OutOfLuck
   Sorry, you’re out of luck.

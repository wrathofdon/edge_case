  Buttons are a special type of block which can activate event handlers upon being clicked.  If you've read the "getting started" guide, then you should already have a basic introduction to  how buttons work.  Here is how you create a card link with a button:

  [bq]Script:
  [eccode]~[button cardlink:'Buttons-Intro']Clicking this will simply reload the page~[/button][/eccode]
  Output:
  [button cardlink:'Buttons-Intro']Clicking this will simply reload the page[/button][/bq]

[/card]

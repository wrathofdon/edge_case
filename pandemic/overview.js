Pandemic is a cooperative game. The players all win or lose together.
Each player has a specific role with special abilities to improve the team's chances.

[b]Win Conditions[/b]
The goal is to discover cures for all 4 diseases.

Please complete the following:

==@Setup_1==

==@Setup_2==
[toggle=[b]2. Place outbreaks and cure markers[/b]]
[ul][*]Place the outbreaks marker on the "0" space of the Outbreaks Track.

[toggle=[b]3. Place infection rate marker and infect 9 cities[/b]]
[ul][*] Place the infection rate marker on the left-most "2" space of the Infection Rate Track.
[*]Shuffle the Infection cards and flip over 3 of them. Put 3 disease cubes of the matching color on each of these cities.
[*] Flip over 3 more cards: put 2 disease cubes on each of these cities.

==@Setup_4==
[toggle=[b]4. Give each player cards and a pawn [/b]]

Divide the remaining player cards into face down piles, as equal in size as you can, so that the number of piles matches the number of Epidemic cards you are using.[br][br]Shuffle 1 Epidemic card into each pile, face down. Stack these piles to form the Player Deck, placing smaller piles on the bottom.[/toggle]

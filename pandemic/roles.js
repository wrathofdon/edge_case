===$Roles===
[b]Roles[/b]
Each player has a role with special abilities to improve your team's chances.

==@Planner==

[toggle=[b]CONTINGENCY PLANNER ABILITIES[/b]]
The Contingency Planner may, as an action, take an Event card from anywhere in the Player Discard Pile and place it on his Role card. Only 1 Event card can be on his role card at a time. It does not count against his hand limit.
When the Contingency Planner plays the Event card on his role card, remove this Event card from the game (instead of discarding it).
[/toggle]

==@Operations==

[toggle=[b]OPERATIONS EXPERT ABILITIES[/b]]
The Operations Expert may, as an action, either:
[ul][*] build a research station in his current city without discarding (or using) a City card, or
[*] once per turn, move from a research station to any city by discarding any City card.[/ul]
[b]The Dispatcher may not use the Operations Expert's special move ability when moving the Operation Expert's pawn.[/b][/toggle]

==@Dispatch==

[toggle=[b]DISPATCHER ABILITIES[/b]]
The Dispatcher may, as an action, either:
[ul][*] move any pawn, if its owner agrees, to any city containing another pawn, or
[*]  move another player's pawn, if its owner agrees, as if it were his own.[/ul]
When moving a player's pawn as if it were your own, discard cards for Direct and Charter Flights from your hand. A card discarded for a Charter Flight must match the city the pawn is moving from.[br][br]
The Dispatcher can only move other players' pawns; he may not direct them to do other actions, such as Treat Disease.[br][br]
[b]The Dispatcher may not use the Operations Expert's special move ability when moving the Operation Expert's pawn.[/b][/toggle]

==@Quarantine==

[toggle=[b]QUARANTINE SPECIALIST ABILITIES[/b]]
The Quarantine Specialist prevents both outbreaks and the placement of disease cubes in the city she is in and all cities connected to that city. She does not affect cubes placed during setup.[/toggle]

==@Medic==

[toggle=[b]MEDIC ABILITIES[/b]]
The Medic removes all cubes, not 1, of the same color when doing the Treat Disease action.
[b]If a disease has been cured, he automatically removes all cubes of that color from a city, simply by entering it or being there. This does not take an action.[/b]
The Medic also prevents placing disease cubes (and outbreaks) of cured diseases in his location[/toggle]

==@Researcher==

[toggle=[b]RESEARCHER ABILITIES[/b]]
When doing the Share Knowledge action, the Researcher may give any City card from her hand to another player in the same city as her, without this card having to match her city. The transfer must be from her hand to the other player's hand, but it can occur on either player's turn.
[toggle=Hand limit (7 cards) applies immediately.][cite]$Play.Draw@Limit[/cite][/toggle]
[/toggle]

==@Scientist==

[toggle=[b]SCIENTIST ABILITIES[/b]]
The Scientist needs only 4 (not 5) City cards of the same disease color to Discover a Cure for that disease.[/toggle]
